# Jupyter notebook export to PDF template using Nbconvert 7

## Why this repo exists

I needed to generate pretty PDF file with my calculations in PDF format from my Jupyter notebook. I tried using the examples from nb_pdf_template repository and some of the things didn't work. Some features where missing. I tryed my best to understand the documentation in figure out the working template for the jupyter notebook export to PDF using nbconvert 7. I hope this will help you understand how to do your template from your great work.

## How to use the template

Copy export_template_pdf folder to your jupyter notebook project folder. 
edit index.tex.j2. Insert the document name, header and footer data. Adjust \graphicspath with the path to the project.
Copy the last cell from the pdf_export_example.ipynb to your project. Use it for pdf generation.
